# What is a server?
- It is like a CPU or a machine which handles requests.
- Previously JS only runs on client side- Front end
- Now it can run on servers also- Back end(run by Java etc previously)
- Now JS can do both front end and back end- Together called Full Stack

# 
- JS Engine uses V8 to run JS code. But V8 is built using C++. At the end of the day, JS is a C++ program   -- Interesting Fact
- V8 understands JS code and converts into Machine understandable code for execution
- V8 can be embedded into any C++ application
- Node.js is a C++ application with V8 embededded into it

#
- Every JS Engine should adhere to ECMAScript standards
### Q. If V8 can run JS code then what is the need of Node.js? We can put V8 on server to run JS on server right?
- V8 must adhere to ECMAScript standards. So it cannot go outside ECMAScript standards and run directly on server. Node.js has extra super powers along with V8 embedded which when run on server makes it powerful.
- Superpowers are APIs(written in JS) on server, modules
- If we have to make a network request to another computer or something, V8 cannot do that as it is not in ECMAScript standards. Only job of V8 is to run JS code. It cannot connect to database, fetch in file system etc.
- V8+superpowers= JS runtime= Node.js
